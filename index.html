The web consists of:<br>
<em>Servers</em> --> hold the content (HTML documents)<br>
<em>HTTP requests</em> --> sent from browser to server to get the correct HTML docs<br>
<em>Browsers</em> --> interpret the HTML docs for a user's computer<br>
<em>Computers</em> --> where people interact with the internet (via browsers)<br>

<a href = "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> has a good explanation.<br>
<p><b>HTML</b></p>

<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.<br><br>
While there are many types of documents (text, images, videos, etc.) 
on the web, HTML docs are the main type of document making up the internet.
</p>
<p>HTML is made up of:<br>
<em>Text content</em> (what you see on webpages)<br>
<em>Markup</em> (what the text looks like - its formatting)<br>
<em>References to other documents</em> (e.g. images and videos)<br>
<em>Links</em> (to other webpages)</p>

Markup is made of tags. Tags are indicated by angle brackets.<br>
An opening tag + contents + closing tag is an <b>element</b>.

<p>Attributes go inside tags and assign the tag a value. For instance,
a is the anchor tag. If you add the href attribute, and assign
a web address, you have created a link. The text of the link will
be whatever is in the contents of the tag.</p>

IMAGE tags (img) are an example of <b>void</b> tags. That means they don't
have closing tags. Void tags have no content. 

<p>Image tags have two attributes, the source (src) -- a web address 
where the image is stored -- and an alternate (alt), which is what
will be shown in the event of a broken request (usually "text").</p>

<p>HTML treats all whitespace as a single space. That means tags are 
necessary to create formatting and whitespace.</p>

<p>br is the tag for a line break<br>
p is the tag for a paragraph</p>

<p>There are two different types of line/paragraph tag, because they
are functionally different. br is an <b>inline tag</b> -- it just ends the
line of text.</p>

p is a <b>block tag</b>. Block tags create a "box" around the contents of the tag.

<p>HTML docs generally consist of a HEAD and a BODY. The head contains 
metadata about the doc, while the body contains the actual content (what 
will appear on the web).</p>
